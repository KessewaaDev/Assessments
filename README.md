# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


📄 README – Front-End Developer Practical Assessment



🚀 Project Overview
This project is a frontend replica of [Autumn.co]
, built as part of a practical front-end assessment. The goal was to recreate the website’s visual layout and interactions using React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring responsiveness and modern UI practices.

* Stack: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git
* Deployment: Vercel / Netlify



🛠️ Tech Stack



* React (framework)
* HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (ES6+)
* Git \& GitHub (version control)
* Vercel / Netlify (deployment)

✅ Features Implemented



* Responsive design (desktop, tablet, mobile)
* Navigation with smooth scrolling
* Hover states \& animations
* Accessibility (alt tags, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
* Clean Git commit history



🧐 Challenges \& Learnings


(Write 3–5 bullet points here about what you found challenging and what you learned while working on this project.)
* Implementing precise layout alignment to match the Autumn.co design taught me to pay attention to spacing, typography and responsiveness

* Learning how to structure react components for scalability and reuse.

* Handling CSS positioning and animations efficiently especially not using width on text elements.

* Strengthened understanding of Git workflows(staging,commiting, and pushing )Learned that every small change needs a commit

* Improved at debugging responsive design issues using DevTools



📌 Improvements If Given More Time



(List 2–3 features you’d improve or add if the project timeline was longer.)

 * Build and connect all remaining pages of the Autumn.  co website and remove all widths from text elements

 * Implement more advanced animations and scroll effects.

 * Optimize performance by lazy-loading images and components
